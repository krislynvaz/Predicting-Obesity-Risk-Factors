# Project Overview
This study investigates how lifestyle behaviors and physical attributes influence obesity levels,
using a dataset of 2,111 individuals that captures demographic, nutritional, and daily-activity
patterns. The main goals of the study included identifying physical and behavioral features that
were associated with a higher risk for obesity and determining which attributes play a bigger role
in predicting individuals at risk.

# Conclusion
This study demonstrates that obesity levels can be predicted with a strong accuracy using
various data mining techniques. While physical attributes such as weight, height, and gender
provide a solid baseline for predicting obesity rates, behavioral characteristics such as eating
habits consistently emerged as the most reliable indicators of obesity risk. Across all models
evaluated, XGBoost delivered the highest overall performance, followed closely by Random
Forest. These models were especially effective at capturing the complex, non-linear
relationships within behavioral data that simpler linear models like logistic regression could not
fully detect.
The results also reveal important insights into the primary influences of obesity classification.
Those with lower physical activity, frequent fast-food consumption, and higher emotional-eating
tendencies were repeatedly classified into higher obesity categories. Also, variables such as
caloric intake (CALC), vegetable consumption (FCVC), and meal frequency (NCP) played
significant roles in the strongest-performing models. These findings reinforce that lifestyle
choices serve as important predictive features when incorporated into machine-learning models.
Overall, the analysis confirms that obesity is strongly rooted in lifestyle patterns, and that
data-driven modeling can support more targeted approaches to weight-related health outcomes.
Lifestyle and behavioral variables offer high-impact, valuable targets for public-health
interventions, preventative wellness programs, and personalized health assessments. By
integrating behavioral and physical indicators, machine learning provides a strong framework for
understanding obesity risk and learning effective health strategies outside of BMI.
